## ATOMIC CHESS - about the project:
This portfolio project was from my Data Structures and Algorithm class at OSU!

Atomic Chess is a fun twist on regular chess with a big difference: when a piece is captured, it "explodes." This explosion removes the captured piece, the capturing piece, and all other pieces (except pawns) around them. Because of this, you can't capture with your king or make a move that blows up both kings at once. Thereâ€™s no check or checkmate, and the game ends when a king is captured or blown up. Some rules from regular chess, like castling and pawn promotion, are not used in Atomic Chess. The game is all about making smart moves to avoid explosive captures.

The ChessVar class contains the logic and state of the chess game, keeping track of whose turn it is. At any point, you can see the state of the game using print_board().

Overall, this project shows a fundamental understanding of Python.
